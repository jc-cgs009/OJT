1. What is cherry-pick?

--> # Cherry picking is the act of picking a commit from a branch and applying it to another. git cherry-pick can be useful for undoing changes. 
      For example, say a commit is accidently made to the wrong branch. You can switch to the correct branch and cherry-pick the commit to where it should belong.

    # With the "cherry-pick" command, Git allows you to integrate selected, individual commits from any branch into your current HEAD branch.
